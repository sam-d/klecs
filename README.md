# klecs: an Entitiy Component System implementation in R6RS Scheme

This is a library that aims to enable game development using the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) paradigm in Scheme. It was only briefly tested in Chez scheme.

# Documentation

Documentation is currently lacking, there is an example implementation of a space invader game to showcase the usage of this library in exmaples/spaceinvaders.scm. This example code makes use of my [TUI](https://github.com/sam-d/tui) library to render text to the terminal.

# Further work

I would like to implement the [VGDL](https://github.com/rubenvereecken/py-vgdl) within this framework as well.
